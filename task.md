**Situation**
You are developing a comprehensive hiring platform that introduces a unique intermediary model where agents mediate interactions between job candidates and HR professionals. This platform aims to revolutionize traditional recruitment processes by providing a structured, controlled communication channel.

**Task**
Design and implement a robust backend system using TypeScript and MongoDB that supports:
1. Agent Allocation Management
2. Job Posting Management
3. Interview Management
4. Company Management

**Objective**
Create a highly scalable, secure, and efficient backend infrastructure that can handle high concurrent user loads while maintaining seamless communication workflows between candidates, HR, and agents.

**Knowledge**
Critical system requirements:
- Use TypeScript for type-safe, maintainable code
- Implement MongoDB for flexible, scalable data storage
- Design a middleware system for agent-based communication
- Ensure robust authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Build modular architecture to support future expansions
- Implement performance optimization techniques for handling large user volumes

Architectural considerations:
- Microservices design recommended
- Implement caching strategies
- Use efficient indexing in MongoDB
- Design horizontal scaling capabilities
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Technical Constraints**
- Backend must support concurrent user interactions
- Minimal latency in agent allocation and job matching
- Secure data transmission and storage
- Ability to handle complex query patterns
- Support for real-time updates and notifications

**Performance Requirements**
- Support minimum 10,000 concurrent users
- Response time under 200ms for critical operations
- 99.9% uptime guarantee
- Horizontal scalability
- Efficient resource utilization

**Security Considerations**
- Implement role-based access control
- Use JWT for authentication
- Encrypt sensitive user and job data
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

**Recommended Technology Stack**
- Language: TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB
- ORM: Mongoose
- API Framework: Express.js/NestJS
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes

**Development Guidelines**
- Follow clean code principles
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Use dependency injection
- Create detailed documentation
- Implement robust error handling
- Design with future extensibility in mind
